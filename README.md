# BIPV Solar Potential Calculator for Ahmedabad City

A project for **Smart India Hackathon 2024**, designed for ISRO to calculate Building-Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) solar potential in Ahmedabad city using a **3D model** built with **Three.js** and a frontend powered by **Next.js**.

## Features

- **Dynamic 3D Model Visualization:** Interactive 3D models of Ahmedabad buildings using Three.js.
- **Real-Time Sunlight Simulation:** Accurate sunlight direction and intensity based on latitude, longitude, and time.
- **Solar Potential Calculation:** Estimates energy generation potential using area, solar irradiance, and panel efficiency.
- **User Interaction:** Allows users to select buildings and timeframes to analyze specific solar energy potentials.

## Key Functionalities

### 1. Solar Potential Calculation
- Uses building geometry (roof and wall areas) and solar irradiance data to calculate potential energy output.

### 2. Sunlight Simulation
- Computes real-time sun positions based on user-selected time and geographical coordinates.

### 3. 3D Navigation
- Allows users to explore the city model, select buildings, and view results dynamically.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the app.
2. Select a building from the interactive 3D scene.
3. Choose a time for solar potential analysis.
4. Click **"Calculate Solar Potential"** to view energy output.
